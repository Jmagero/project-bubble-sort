# project-bubble-sort

> This project is about creating a method(bubble_sort.rb) that uses the bubble sort algorithm. The method takes in an array of integers as an argument and sorts the elements in ascending order.
The second method (buble_sort_by.rb) takes in array of string and uses the yield keyword to pass a block to the method. The methods can also sort in descending order with little modification.
